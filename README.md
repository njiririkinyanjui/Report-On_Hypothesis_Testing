# Report-On_Hypothesis_Testing
As a data scientist of COOLANT AGENCY solving an issue of the difference in blue cars taken.
* According to our research question; Is the number of Blue cars taken in the weekend between day 5 and day 6 equal?
* The null hypothesis is recorded as H0, while the alternate is Ha.
* Mathematical representation:
* H0: Day 5 = Day 6
* Ha: Day 5 ≠ Day 6
* Let’s set our alpha (α) to be 0.05 at a 5% significance level. But since it’s a two sample hypothesis the α is divided by 2 (α / 2).
